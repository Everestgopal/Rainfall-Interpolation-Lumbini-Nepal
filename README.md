## Project Overview

Accurate rainfall estimation is crucial for hydrological management and agricultural planning in Lumbini Province, Nepal. This project compares four spatial interpolation methods—Inverse Distance Weighting (IDW), Radial Basis Function (RBF), Ordinary Kriging (OK), and Universal Kriging (UK)—to determine the most reliable technique for estimating rainfall distribution across diverse terrain.

## Data and Methods

- Rainfall data collected from 39 meteorological stations by the Department of Hydrology and Meteorology, Nepal, covering the period from 2000 to 2023.  
- Data processing and spatial interpolation performed using Python and ArcGIS Pro.  
- Cross-validation approach with 75% training data and 25% testing data to evaluate method performance.  
- Performance metrics include Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and coefficient of determination (R²).
